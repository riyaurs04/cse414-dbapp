# CSE 414 - Database Application

This is one of the projects I worked on as part of the coursework for CSE 414 (Database Management) at the University of Washington.
In this project, I developed an appointment scheduling system using Java and SQL via JDBC. This system supports vaccine appointments by implementing patient management, caregiver scheduling, and vaccine inventory tracking. I designed and integrated the database schema on Microsoft Azure, including user authentication and secure password storage using cryptography techniques.
